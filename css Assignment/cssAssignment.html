    <li>Benefits of CSS are as folllowing:<br><br>

       - Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, etc.<br>
      
       - CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.<br>

       - Easy maintenance − To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.<br>
    
       - Global web standards − Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it's a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with
        future browsers.<br>
    
       -Platform Independence − The Script offer consistent platform independence and can support latest browsers as well.</li><br><br>

      <li>Disadvantages of CSS:<br><br>

-CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among  web browsers.<br>

-With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.<br>
-There exists a scarcity of security.<br>
-After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change affects on all the browsers.<br>
-The programing language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. Different levels of CSS i.e. CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing.<br>
-Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not).<br>
-CSS works differently on different browsers. IE and Opera supports CSS as different logic.<br>
-There might be cross-browser issues while using CSS.<br>
-There are multiple levels which creates confusion for non-developers and beginners.<br><br>

<li>Difference between CSS2 and CSS3 are as follows:<br><br>
    -The biggest difference between CSS2 and CSS3 is that CSS3 is now split into different modules. Since each module makes its way through the W3C individually, there’s a wider range of browser support. Make sure you test your CSS3 pages in as many browsers and operating systems as possible to ensure compatibility.<br>
    -Unlike CSS2, which was comprised of a single document, CSS3 has its specifications divided into many individual modules, which makes CSS3 a whole lot easier to handle. With CSS3, the designers can now use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast.</li><br><br>

    <li>Few CSS style components are as follows:<br><br>
        -Selector: class name, id name or element name that is target.<br>
        -Attribute: name of the attribute you want to style for example border, color, background, position etc.<br>
        -Value of Property: value that will be assigned to attribute.</li><br><br>

        <li>CSS OPACITY:<br><br>
            -The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element.<br>
            -Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency<br>
            -The opacity-level describes the transparency-level, where 1 is not transparent at all, 0.5 is 50% see-through, and 0 is completely transparent.<br>
            -When using the opacity property to add transparency to the background of an element, all of its child elements become transparent as well. This can make the text inside a fully transparent element hard to read. If you do not want to apply opacity to child elements, use RGBA color values.</li><br><br>


        <li>The background-color property sets the background color of an element. <br>
            The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin).<br>
            Use a background color and a text color that makes the text easy to read.</li><br><br>

            <li>Image repetition of the backup  can be controlled by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image.<br>

                The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically.<br> 
                It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.</li><br><br>


                <li>The background-position property in CSS is mainly used to sets the initial position for the background image ie., it is used to set an image at a certain position.<br> 
                    The position that is relative to the positioning layer, can be set by using the background-origin property.<br>
                    The background-image is placed default to the top-left corner of an element with a repetition on both horizontally & vertically.</li><br><br>

                    <li>The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.<br>
                        The background-attachment property in CSS is used to specify the kind of attachment of the background image with respect to its container.<br>
                        It can be applied to all HTML elements.</li><br><br>

                        <li> There are two reasons of using background and color as separate properties:<br>
                        1)The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.<br>
                        2)It enhances the legibility of style sheets.</li><br><br>


                        <li>There are two steps to center a block-elements using CSS1: –<br><br>

                            Step 1: Define the external width – We need to define the external width. Block-level elements have the default width of 100% of the webpage, so for centering the block element, we need space around it. So for generating the space, we are giving it a width.<br><br>
                            
                            Step 2: Set the left-margin and the right-margin of the element to auto – Since we produced a remaining space by providing external width so now we need to align that space properly that’s why we should use margin property. Margin is a property that tells how to align a remaining space. So for centering the element you must set left-margin to auto and right-margin to auto.</li><br><br>

                            <li>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).<br>
                                CSS is easy to maintain due to less maintenance time. This is because a single line code change affects the entire web page. Also, if improvements are required, then less effort is required to affect changes in the webpage code.<br>
                                The easiest way to see all of the CSS specs is to take a look at the Current Work page in the CSS section of the W3C Website. </li><br><br>


                                <li>There are three ways to integrate CSS as a Web page:<br><br>


                                    1. Inline: HTML elements may have CSS applied to them via the STYLE attribute.<br>
                                    
                                    
                                    2. Embedded: By placing the code in a STYLE element within the HEAD element.<br>
                                    
                                    
                                    3. Linked/ Imported: Place the CSS in an external file and link it via a link element.</li><br><br>



                                    <li>Using embedded style sheets will allow you to begin unleashing the full power of CSS by enabling you to apply styles to all HTML elements of a particular type on an entire web page.<br>
                                        Embedded style sheets refer to when you embed style sheet information into an HTML document using the(<>) style element.<br> 
                                        You do this by embedding the style sheet information within (<>)style,/styletags in the head of your document.</li><br><br>


                                        <li>An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage.<br>
                                             Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet.<br>
                                             The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.</li><br><br>



                                             <li>The advantages of External Style Sheets are:<br><br>

                                                - Using them, the styles of multiple documents can be controlled from one file.<br>
                                                - Classes can be created for use on multiple HTML element types in many documents.<br>
                                                - In complex situations, selector and grouping methods can be used to apply styles.<br><br>
                                                
                                                The disadvantages of External Style Sheets are:<br><br>
                                                
                                                - In order to import style information for each document, an extra download is needed.<br>
                                                - Until the external style sheet is loaded, it may not be possible to render the document.<br>
                                                - For small number of style definitions, it is not viable.</li><br><br>


                                                <li>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule.<br>
                                                    It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.</li><br><br>


                        
                                             <li>Some media types allowed by CSS are:<br><br>
                                                -all:Suitable for all devices.<br>
-braille:
Intended for braille tactile feedback devices.<br>
-embossed:
Intended for paged braille printers.<br>
-handheld:
Intended for handheld devices (typically small screen, limited bandwidth).<br>
-print:
Intended for paged material and for documents viewed on screen in print preview mode. Please consult the section on paged media for information about formatting issues that are specific to paged media.
<br>-projection:
Intended for projected presentations, for example projectors. Please consult the section on paged media for information about formatting issues that are specific to paged media.
<br>-screen:
Intended primarily for color computer screens.
<br>-speech:
Intended for speech synthesizers. Note: CSS2 had a similar media type called 'aural' for this purpose. See the appendix on aural style sheets for details.
<br>-tty:
Intended for media using a fixed-pitch character grid (such as teletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited display capabilities). Authors should not use pixel units with the "tty" media type.<br>
-tv:
Intended for television-type devices (low resolution, color, limited-scrollability screens, sound available).
Media type names are case-insensitive.<br>

Media types are mutually exclusive in the sense that a user agent can only support one media type when rendering a document. However, user agents may use different media types on different canvases.
