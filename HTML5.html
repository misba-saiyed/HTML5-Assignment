    <li>The new tags added in HTML5 are as follows: <br><br>-
      Article tag: The article tag is one of the new sectioning element in HTML5. The HTML article tag is used to represent an article. More specifically, the content within the article tag is independent of the other content of the site (even though it can be related).<br><br>
     - aside tag: The aside tag is used to describe the main object of the web page in a shorter way like a highlighter. It basically identifies the content that is related to the primary content of the web page but does not constitute the main intent of the primary page.It contains mainly author information, links, related content, and so on.<br><br>
     - audio tag: The audio tag is used to insert an audio into an HTML webpage.<br><br>
     -canvas tag: The canvas tag in HTML is used to draw graphics on a web page using JavaScript. It can be used to draw paths, boxes, texts, gradients, and add images. By default, it does not contain borders and text.<br><br>
     -command tag: The command tag define a command button, invoke as per user action. The command tag button is used in a special type of operation. The command tag is supported only by Internet Explorer.<br><br>
     -datalist tag: The datalist tag is used to provide autocomplete feature in the HTML files. It can be used with an input tag so that users can easily fill the data in the forms using select the data.<br><br>
     -details tag: The details tag is used for the content/information which is initially hidden but could be displayed if the user wishes to see it. This tag is used to create an interactive widget that the user can open or close.The content of the details tag is visible when opening the set attributes.<br><br>
     -embed tag: This tag in HTML is used for embedding external applications which are generally multimedia content like audio or video into an HTML document. It is used as a container for embedding plug-ins such as flash animations. This tag is a new tag in HTML 5, and it requires only starting tag.<br><br>
     -figure tag: The figure tag in HTML is used to add self-contained content like illustrations, diagrams, photos, or codes listing in a document. It is related to the main flow, but it can be used in any position of a document and the figure goes with the flow of the document and if remove it then it should not affect the flow of the document. This tag is new in HTML5.<br><br>
     -footer tag: The footer tag in HTML is used to define a footer of HTML document. This section contains the footer information (author information, copyright information, carriers, etc).<br><br>
     -nav tag: The nav tag is used for declaring the navigational section in HTML documents.<br><br>
     -progress tag: It is used to represent the progress of a task. It is also defined how much work is done and how much is left to download a thing.<br><br>
     -video tag: The video tag is used to embed video content in a document, such as a movie clip or other video streams and so many others tags are also there.<br>
    note-All tags should be in <>.</li><br><br><br>


    <li>There are two different ways to include video elements:<br><br>
        
        -Video Element:
        The video element allows us to embed video files into an HTML, very similar to the way images are embedded.<br><br>
        
        Attributes we can include are:<br>
        
        1)src -This attribute stands for the source, which is very similar to the src attribute used in the image element. We will add the link to a video file in the src attribute.<br>
        2)type -This is going to be video/mp4 because .mp4 is the format of the video we are using. We can also use different video formats like .ogg or .webm, then the value of type attribute will change to video/ogg or video/WebM respectively.<br><br>

        -Audio Element:
 The audio element is very similar to the video element. However, the only major difference is that there are no visuals.

We can use the audio element to play an audio file on our web page — such as an mp3 file.

Now, just like the video tag, there are two different ways to do this:<br><br>

1)Use a single tag representing the entire element.<br>
2)Opening and closing tag with the child elements in between.<br>
Now, we’ll have an opening and closing audio tag, and then we will add the source element in between,etc.</li><br><br><br>


<li>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.<br>
    Examples of semantic elements: form, table, and article - Clearly defines its content.<br><br>
   - Semantics in CSS:
    In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?<br><br>

  -Semantics in HTML:
 In HTML, for example, the h1 element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."<br><br>

 -Semantics in JavaScript:
 In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an li element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?</li>.<br><br><br>


 <li>Canvas and SVG tags  are as follows;<br><br>
    
    ->Canvas: The HTML canvas element is used to draw graphics, via JavaScript. 
        <br>-The canvas element is a container for graphics.Canvas has poor scalability. Hence it is not suitable for printing on higher resolution.
        <br> -Canvas gives better performance with smaller surface or larger number of objects.
        <br> -Canvas can be modified through script only
        <br> -Canvas is raster based and composed of pixel,etc.<br> <br>
    
    ->SVG: The HTML svg element is a container for SVG graphics.SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. SVG and useful for defining graphics such as boxes, circles, text, etc. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and is a language for describing 2D-graphics and graphical applications in XML and the XML is then rendered by an SVG viewer. Most of the web browsers can display SVG just like they can display PNG, GIF, and JPG.<br>
    -SVG has better scalability. So it can be printed with high quality at any resolution<br>
    -SVG gives better performance with smaller number of objects or larger surface.<br>
    -SVG can be modified through script and CSS.<br>
    -SVG is vector based and composed of shapes,etc.</li><br><br><br>
